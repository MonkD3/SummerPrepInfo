The Linux kernel is a free and open-source,[5][6] monolithic, modular,[7] multitasking, Unix-like  operating system kernel.[8] 
 It was conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds[9] for his i386-based PC, and it was soon adopted as the kernel for the GNU operating system,[10] 
 which was created as a free replacement for UNIX.[11] 
 Since then, it has spawned a large number of operating system distributions, commonly also called Linux.
